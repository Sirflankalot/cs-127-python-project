# Anton and Connor's Final CS127 Project

##Project Description

Our project is a web application for searching key terms within multiple datasets. We plan to implement basic sentiment analysis and stemming, along with a smart search algorithm for multiple key terms. Our web page will allow for easy navigation between documents and results, provide document statistics relevant to the search and highlight all results for the user. In addition, we plan to implement caching for elevated performance of repetitive searches.
